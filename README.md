# Interactive Immersive Multimedia Generation

## Overview

This is the project repository for CMU 10-615 Art and Machine Learning's final project. Given a spoken speech as input, we generate a film that consits of music, lyrics, and images.

Our resulting videos can be found under the /video directory.
