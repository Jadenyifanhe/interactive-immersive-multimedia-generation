everything is going to be okay
No one can see or hear us anymore
They pretend to be strangers
But all the love they bring
And the scars on our souls
And our minds forever fractured

I want to run
I want to run on my own
You want to be afraid
Of everything
You want to adore us
But weve just gone
And Im losing

I want to run, baby
You want to adore us
But theyve just gone
And Im losing
I want to run, baby
Dont let yourself dow
If you could stop pretending
Your beautiful 
And dont let yourself go

I want to run, baby
I want to run, baby
Dont let yourself down
Its okay
We should be alone
And we should

everything is going to be okay
Dont let yourself go
Let the darkness consume
Youre still alive
And we are fighting for our lives
If you do not stop the darkness
Then let the gods understand
Let them control the fate of us
Oh oh oh
Theyll do whatever they want
You can choose
You can choose
We will fight
We will fight
You will be okay
Dont let yourself go
Let the darkness consume
Youre still alive

-- prompt: I am feeling good --

I am feeling good and feeling good on my own
Ill be rolling next summer
Down in the easy chair
Genghis Khan, he couldnt keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
Well, Ive just climbed out of bed
And Im sitting on the sofa
Wonderin why Im feelin so good
On my own
Yes, Ill be rolling next summer
Down in the easy chair
Come around you, little girl
Bring me my broom
Leave me by your door
I’ll do anything for you
You may call me Terry, Terry, hey, hey, hey
Whatever you need, you can always come with me
When the deal goes down
Well, I will pawn my watch
And chain it to my waist
You’ll be rolling by me pretty fast
You’ll catch my bus
When I’m in L.A
Oh, you will ride by me

-- input prompt: I woke up too late today --

I woke up too late today, must be the sun
Aint got a fortune and I cant pretend to give
A little bit of greed mixed with some hard liquor
Some dogma thatll brainwash your world picture
And a shock when you get mocked at the job you hate
By the boss when you’re not co-operating
Cause youre not giving up while the world is shaking!
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause we are back on the streets and demonstrating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Teacher
But our planets health problems complicating!
So the NDCs and SDGs
Are technically our last chance to keep
Global warming below 1.5 degrees
So Id say: Lets take to the streets
So call all your friends, tell em to dance
Cut that - Tell em to act and panic instead
And get ready, cause this shits about to get heavy
They be stealing our future
